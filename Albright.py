Our project will be an Albright College Sports Team manager site. The program will 
allow users to view and manage albright sports team basic informational needs, 
including player names, positions, stats, injury reports,and yearly progress. 
Users will be able to add, remove, and edit players, view upcoming games, and show individual, 
and team summaries.This project connects to the Albright theme by focusing on campus athletics
while letting us practice real world programming like data storage, and user interaction.
